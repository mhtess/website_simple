# MH Tessler

Hi, I'm MH. My full name is Michael Henry Tessler.
I am a Research Scientist at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com).
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow working in the [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences](http://bcs.mit.edu) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu) with [Roger Levy](http://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/index.html) (and the [Computational Psycholinguistics Lab](http://cpl.mit.edu)) and [Josh Tenenbaum](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html) (and the [Computational Cognitive Science Group](http://cocosci.mit.edu)).
I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Psychology](https://psychology.stanford.edu) at [Stanford](http://stanford.edu), where I worked with [Noah Goodman](http://cocolab.stanford.edu/ndg.html) and the [CoCoLab](http://cocolab.stanford.edu/index.html).

I am interested in how people convey meaning in language and how we learn from language.
I view language through the lens of psychology, and psychology through the lens of computer science and statistics.

I occasionally write [stories about travels](https://tesslertravels.blogspot.com).
