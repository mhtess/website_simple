	Abstract = {Generalizations about categories are central to human understanding, and generic language (e.g. "Dogs bark.") provides a simple and ubiquitous way to communicate these generalizations. Yet the meaning of generic language is philosophically puzzling and has resisted precise formalization. We explore the idea that the core meaning of a generic sentence is simple but underspecified, and that general principles of pragmatic reasoning are responsible for establishing the precise meaning in context. Building on recent probabilistic models of language understanding, we provide a formal model for the evaluation and comprehension of generic sentences. This model explains the puzzling flexibility in usage of generics in terms of diverse prior beliefs about properties. We elicit these priors experimentally and show that the resulting model predictions explain almost all of the variance in human judgments for both common and novel generics. We probe the theory in more detail, and find that generic language depends in a fundamental way on subjective beliefs, not mere frequency. This theory provides the mathematical bridge between the words we use and the concepts they describe.},

@article{stevens2015votc,
	Abstract = {One of the most robust and oft-replicated findings in cognitive neuroscience is that several spatially distinct, functionally dissociable ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC) regions respond preferentially to different categories of concrete entities. However, the determinants of this category-related organization remain to be fully determined. One recent proposal is that privileged connectivity of these VOTC regions with other regions that store and/or process category-relevant properties may be a major contributing factor. To test this hypothesis, we used a multicategory functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) localizer to individually define category-related brain regions of interest (ROIs) in a large group of subjects (n = 33). We then used these ROIs in resting-state functional connectivity MRI analyses to explore spontaneous functional connectivity among these regions. We demonstrate that during rest, distinct category-preferential VOTC regions show differentially stronger functional connectivity with other regions that have congruent category-preference, as defined by the functional localizer. Importantly, a "tool"-preferential region in the left medial fusiform gyrus showed differentially stronger functional connectivity with other left lateralized cortical regions associated with perceiving and knowing about common tools-posterior middle temporal gyrus (involved in perception of nonbiological motion), lateral parietal cortex (critical for reaching, grasping, manipulating), and ventral premotor cortex (involved in storing/executing motor programs)-relative to other category-related regions in VOTC of both the right and left hemisphere. Our findings support the claim that privileged connectivity with other cortical regions that store and/or process category-relevant properties constrains the category-related organization of VOTC.},

@article{stevens2017vwfa,
	Abstract = {The visual word form area (VWFA) is a region in the left occipitotemporal sulcus of literate individuals that is purportedly specialized for visual word recognition. However, there is considerable controversy about its functional specificity and connectivity, with some arguing that it serves as a domain-general, rather than word-specific, visual processor. The VWFA is a critical region for testing hypotheses about the nature of cortical organization, because it is known to develop only through experience (i.e., reading acquisition), and widespread literacy is too recent to have influenced genetic determinants of brain organization. Using a combination of advanced fMRI analysis techniques, including individual functional localization, multivoxel pattern analysis, and high-resolution resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) analyses, with data from 33 healthy adult human participants, we demonstrate that (1) the VWFA can discriminate words from nonword letter strings (pseudowords); (2) the VWFA has preferential RSFC with Wernicke's area and other core regions of the language system; and (3) the strength of the RSFC between the VWFA and Wernicke's area predicts performance on a semantic classification task with words but not other categories of visual stimuli. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the VWFA is specialized for lexical processing of real words because of its functional connectivity with Wernicke's area.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The visual word form area (VWFA) is critical for determining the nature of category-related organization of the ventral visual system. However, its functional specificity and connectivity are fiercely debated. Recent work concluded that the VWFA is a domain-general, rather than word-specific, visual processor with no preferential functional connectivity with the language system. Using more advanced techniques, our results stand in stark contrast to these earlier findings. We demonstrate that the VWFA is highly specialized for lexical processing of real words, and that a fundamental factor driving this specialization is its preferential intrinsic functional connectivity with core regions of the language system. Our results support the hypothesis that intrinsic functional connectivity contributes to category-related specialization within the human ventral visual system.},

Here, we present a general and principled approach to experiment design based on probabilistic programming languages (PPLs). PPLs offer a clean separation between declaring problems and solving them, which means that the scientist can automate experiment design by simply declaring her model and experiment spaces in the PPL without having to worry about the details of calculating information gain. We demonstrate our system in two case studies drawn from cognitive psychology, where we use it to design optimal experiments in the domains of sequence prediction and categorization. We find strong empirical validation that our automatically designed experiments were indeed optimal. We conclude by discussing a number of interesting questions for future research.},

	Abstract = {World knowledge enters into pragmatic utterance interpreta- tion in complex ways, and may be defeasible in light of speak- ers' utterances. Yet there is to date a surprising lack of sys- tematic investigation into the role of world knowledge in prag- matic inference. In this paper, we show that a state-of-the-art model of pragmatic interpretation greatly overestimates the in- fluence of world knowledge on the interpretation of utterances like Some of the marbles sank. We extend the model to cap- ture the idea that the listener is uncertain about the background knowledge the speaker is bringing to the conversation. This extension greatly improves model predictions of listeners' in- terpretation and also makes good qualitative predictions about listeners' judgments of how `normal' the world is in light of a speaker's statement. Theoretical and methodological implica- tions are discussed. Keywords:},

	Abstract = {Three different types of traffic flow models are considered: time continuous microscopic, time discrete microscopic and macroscopic. All three models are used to estimate the time necessary for the evauation of Bird Island, North Carolina, in the case for instance of a hurricane. The typical underlying assumptions related to the use of each model are discussed together with their relative pros and cons. In spite of their fundamental differences, all three approaches lead to comparable results regarding evacuation times. Evacuation strategy is also discussed.},

@article{yuan2017socrand,
	Abstract = {Generating truly random sequences is hard. When participants are engaged in a competitive game (e.g., Matching Pennies), the sequences they generate are surprisingly more random than when given explicit instructions to generate random sequences (Rapoport and Budescu, 1992). To explore this phenomenon, we formalized two probabilistic models of Theory of Mind reasoning about subjective randomness. One model (the Fair-Coin model) assumes participants predict their opponents' choices by implicitly assuming that their opponents intend to generate binary sequences that simulate the outcome of tossing a fair coin. The other model (the Markov model) assumes participants believe that their opponents intend to generate sequences that simulate the outcome of a Markov process with transition probability equal to 0.5. We find that Theory of Mind models of both the Fair-Coin and the Markov definitions of subjective randomness are able to characterize the calibrated subjective randomness that occurs when participants are playing an iterated competitive game (Matching Pennies), but the Markov Model is better than the Fair-Coin Model in simulating the situation where participants need to specify their choice sequences in advance of the game. The current study suggests that the calibrated subjective randomness in competitive games can be explained by the online evaluation of sequence randomness with Theory of Mind reasoning.},

@inproceedings{yoon2017indirect,
	Abstract = {Why are we polite when we talk to one another? One hypoth-esis is that people expect others to choose what to say based on their goals both to transfer information efficiently (an epis-temic goal) and to make the listener feel good (a social goal). In our previous work, we found that when these two goals con-flict, they sometimes produce white lies. In the current work, we expand on this theory to consider another prominent case of polite speech: indirect remarks using negation (e.g., " It wasn't amazing "). With minimal extensions from our previous frame-work, our formal model suggests that a pragmatic speaker will produce more indirect remarks when the speaker wants to be informative and seem considerate at the same time. These predictions were borne out in a language production experi-ment. These findings suggest that the conflict between social and epistemic goals can account for a broad range of politeness phenomena.},
